There are mainly 2 types of hashing techniques:

1. Chaining.
2. Open Addressing.
  A. Single/ Linear Probing
  B. Quadratic Probing
  C. Double Hashing.
 
 
 Chaining : As the name suggests we make the chains using single/ double linked list DS. Advantage here is that the hash table never gets filled. The logic is like that,
 if we ever encounter collision we just add it to the end of chain.
 
 Open Addressing : This method is more dependent on the usage of hash function.
 A. Linear Probing - In this method whenever we encounter the collision we iterate the hash table by 1, untill we find the empty space or we came back to the same element
 again doig whole circle.
  
  Advantage : There is avery high chance of finding an empty space.
  Disadvantage : Creates big linear clusters.
